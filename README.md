Ok fellas, Welcome to part 01 of the HBnB Evolution project.

You'll probably already know this since I've probably mentioned it during PLD, but the code here is meant to be the foundation that you'll all use to learn about the concepts mentioned in the project.

The way the project was written, you were all supposed to create a working web server with multiple endpoints and models from scratch using your own intuition. To be honest, that's going to be difficult for all of you at this point in time.

I've decided instead to give everyone a good code base to start from so that you can all look, investigate and learn from what I've written to better understand how everything works together.

1. There is a UML diagram in the design folder. This is the diagram that the code is based off of.
2. The code is working BUT incomplete. Also, the code is not perfect. There is a lot that can be improved on. Feel free to change it to make your lives easier.
3. Play with the example endpoints in app.py to understand what is going on.
4. Fill in the blanks so that you can fulfill the requirements of the 00-endpoints.md file in Task 2.
5. Note that while you can load data from the JSON files, you can't update and save to them. Perhaps you all might want to do something about this missing feature?
6. A working Dockerfile for Task 3 is in the docker folder. Look at it and understand what I tried to do. It is not perfect. Investigate how you can create a better Dockerfile without using the ubuntu image.
